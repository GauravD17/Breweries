The Random Brewery Finder is a fun and interactive web application that fetches random brewery details using the OpenBreweryDB API.


## Run Locally



Install dependencies

```bash
  npm install
```

Start the server

```bash
  node index.js
```
In your terminal, you will see an output saying:

Server running on port: 3000

Now, don't close the terminal. Open your browser and go to: http://localhost:3000. Here, you will be able to see the site.
